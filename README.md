# FireWatch-Privacy-Preserving-Fire-Detection-System-for-Indoor-Surveillance
Fires are a major safety hazard that can cause significant damage to life and property. Current fire detection solutions using sensors or cameras have limitations in terms of accuracy, false alarms, and inability to detect fires in all areas. Most importantly, regular camera-based approaches cannot be used indoor due to privacy concerns.

To address these challenges, I proposed a computer vision and deep learning based approach. The key aspects of the system are:

A modified near-infrared camera that can accurately capture fire zones without compromising privacy of non-fire areas.

A lightweight Convolutional Neural Network model trained on infrared fire image datasets to classify real-time video frames as fire or non-fire.

Alert generation via mobile app notifications as soon as a fire is detected for quick emergency response.

Storage of historical fire detection clips for subsequent review and analysis.

The privacy-preserving and low-compute design makes the system suitable for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices like Raspberry Pi. Extensive testing achieved accuracy over 95% on real-world test scenarios.

This project demonstrated how computer vision and deep learning techniques can be effectively applied to develop real-world solutions in critical domains like fire safety while addressing practical challenges of privacy, efficiency and cost. I look forward to exploring similar AI safety applications in future.
